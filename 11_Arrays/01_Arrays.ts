Features of an Array
Here is a list of the features of an array −

An array declaration allocates sequential memory blocks.
Arrays are static. This means that an array once initialized cannot be resized.
Each memory block represents an array element.
Array elements are identified by a unique integer called as the subscript / index of the element.
Like variables, arrays too, should be declared before they are used. Use the var keyword to declare an array.
Array initialization refers to populating the array elements.
Array element values can be updated or modified but cannot be deleted.
Declaring and Initializing Arrays

Syntax
var array_name[:datatype];        //declaration 
array_name = [val1,val2,valn..]   //initialization
An array declaration without the data type is deemed to be of the type any. The type of such an array is inferred from the data type of the array’s first element during initialization.

For example, a declaration like − var numlist:number[] = [2,4,6,8] will create an array as given below −

Declaring and Initializing Arrays
The array pointer refers to the first element by default.
Arrays may be declared and initialized in a single statement. The syntax for the same is −

var array_name[:data type] = [val1,val2…valn]
