Duck-typing
In duck-typing, two objects are considered to be of the same type
 if both share the same set of properties. Duck-typing verifies the 
 presence of certain properties in the objects, rather than their 
 actual type, to check their suitability. The concept is generally explained
  by the following phrase −

“When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks
 like a duck, I call that bird a duck.”
