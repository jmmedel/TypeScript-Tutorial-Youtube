External Module
External modules are also known as a module. When the applications
 consisting of hundreds of files, then it is almost impossible to 
 handle these files without a modular approach. External Module is 
 used to specify the load dependencies between the multiple external js files. 
 If the application has only one js file, the external module is not relevant.
